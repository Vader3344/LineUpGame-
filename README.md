# 🎮 ConnectFour - IFN584

Welcome to **ConnectFour**, a modular, assignment-compliant implementation of the classic strategy game — developed by **Group 18** for **IFN584: Software Development** at QUT.

This project showcases clean architecture, robust input validation, and strategic disc management, all wrapped in a user-friendly console interface.
